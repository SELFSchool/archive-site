## Introduction



## The more detailed my notes, the more I learn

Note taking is by far the most common form of studying, it just makes sense to do it. Write down the things your teacher is saying so that you can come back later on and review it, that's the logic that leads people to create notebooks that look like this:

I think people often forget the purpose of note taking, and so they end up taking notes like a court stenographer, writing down every single word the teacher utters. The problem is that the brain doesn't work like a tape recorder, it's not meant to try and remember and process all the details, just the most important one.

The point of note taking is not to record what your teacher says, the point of note taking is writing down the most important aspects of what the teacher says so that your brain can easily review it later on.

## Cramming is the worst way to learn

"Cramming," Pulling an "All-nighter," most of us probably know the feeling, waiting until the 11th hour to quickly go over the last 4 weeks of material as quickly and as adequately as we can to pass an exam, or write a paper.

Cramming has gotten a reputation for being a bad way to study, and for good reason. It's incredibly stress-inducing and ineffective. But that's only when cramming is used as your only learning method.

Studies have shown that cram study methods have significant advantages over spaced repetition study methods in short term retention. Basically, cramming does actually work, kinda, it's why you managed to just scrape by and pass your exam with that 70 you needed, despite being a sleep deprived zombie.



## I should focus on learning one thing for long periods of time 

So it makes sense that that rule should carry over to learning as well, right? Actually, the opposite is true. It's more effective to work on multiple things in short burst intervals, than to work on one distinct thing after another.

For example, say you need to do 2 hours of math, 2 hours of writing, and 2 hours of science homework on a given day. The blocking method says that you should do exactly that: 2 Hours of math, then 2 hours of writing, then 2 hours of science.

The interleaving method, on the other hand, says that you should do 1 hour of math work, 1 hour of writing, 1 hour of science, then another hour of math, an hour of writing, and an hour of science. Studies show as much as a 3:1 difference in retention rates between the two methods.
