The book is centered around six "educational frustrations" in the United States:

1. The Over-Testing of Students
2. The Fadeout of Preschool Gains
3. The Narrowing of the Elementary Curriculum
4. The Low Verbal Scores of High School Graduates
5. The Lack of Progress in Closing Achievement Gaps Between Social Groups
6. The Tribulations of the Common Core Initiative.

Despite being well recognized issues, the problems have evaded solution. Not, however, from lack of will or money, from poverty or the short-comings of teachers, but because they cannot be solved under the reign of faulty ideas that caused them to arise.

These issues have persisted because they are inherent in the procedures and assumptions which have dominated education for so long.

The author claims that the dominant theories are social injustices that unwittingly cause the destruction of the American dream, and that the real issue is unequal opportunity, rather than the sociological and genetic explanations of achievement gaps.

Specifically, the author writes towards the younger generation, he hopes that the stubbornness and close-mindedness that comes with age can be bypassed by publishing this book now, when fresh minds and hearts might read and be inspired to enact true change.
