## Welcome

Welcome to SELF School, we are a community dedicated to helping students. By providing free learning resources like tests, textbooks and practice questions, hosting collaborative learning JET sessions, and providing learning support to any student who needs it, we hope to give students the resources and skills required for them to take control of their learning.
